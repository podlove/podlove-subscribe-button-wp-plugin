### About the Podlove Subscribe Button

The Podlove Subscribe Button allows for simple subscription of podcasts in anybody's favorite podcast app right from the browser without having to deal with pesky feed URLs and go on a hunt for feed subscription dialogues.

The button knows how to activate the subscription functionality in all popular podcast apps supporting various operating systems including but not limited to iOS, Android, WindowsPhone, OSX, Windows and Linux.

The button is centrally hosted and gets permanently updated when new podcast apps emerge or when new features are added. Using the button ensures your podcast can easily be subscribed to and presents an ever more popular user interface that your audience gets more and more used to.

== Installation ==

###  Install the plugin

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

### Configure buttons

1. Navigate to `Settings > Podlove Subscribe Button`
2. Fill out all fields, save and grab the shortcode
3. Add the button to your blog using the shortcode `[podlove-subscribe-button id="{{yourButtonID}}"]` with your button ID, or use the provided Podlove Subscribe Button Widget

### Display the Subscribe Button in your Sidebar using a Widget

Go to `Appearance -> Widgets` and drag the "Podlove Subscribe Button" widget to your sidebar configuration. Select the pre-configured button from the list and determine which style you want. That's it. The button should show up in your sidebar. Optionally add a title and description for your widget.

This is the easiest and recommended way of using this plugin especially if you ony want to display a button for a single podcast. For best visibility choose size "big" and format "cover" to make your Subscribe Button stand out and easily locatable.


### Include the Subscribe Button in WordPress pages using a Shortcode

If you want to include a Podlove Subscribe Button in a WordPress page (or a post) just put the shortcode `[podlove-subscribe-button]` at the desired position in your text. Use the following shortcode parameters to configure it properly:

* `button` - the ID of one of your preconfigured buttons
* `size` - one of 'small', 'medium', 'big'
* `width` - specify desired button width in CSS compatibles values or 'auto' automatic width depending on context.
* `color` - specify the color of the button in a CSS compatible format (keyword, rgb-hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla)
* `style` - default is filled, options are 'outline' and 'frameless'
* `format` - default is a rectangle, options are 'square' and 'cover' (**Note**: 'cover' has a max size of 300px)
* `hide` - if set to `true` the button will not be shown (useful if you want to use your own element)
* `buttonid` - you can use this to open the popup from another element on the same page
* `language` - specify the language the texts on the button and popup should be in (currently supports 'de', 'en', 'eo', 'fi', 'fr', 'nl', 'zh' and 'ja')

Note that if you do not provide one of the attributes the subscribe button will use the globally set default.
